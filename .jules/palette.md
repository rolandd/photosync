## 2026-02-17 - TUI Persistent Keyboard Hints
**Learning:** In TUI applications, users often forget available keybindings if they aren't visible.
**Action:** Always display critical navigation keys (like 'q' to quit) on the screen border using `title_bottom`.

## 2026-02-18 - TUI Status via Border Color
**Learning:** Changing the main container's border color based on success/error state (Red/Green) provides immediate, glanceable feedback without requiring extra text.
**Action:** Use `Block::border_style` dynamically based on application state in TUI apps.

## 2026-02-18 - Elapsed Time Indicator
**Learning:** For long-running batch operations, users need a sense of temporal scale to estimate completion or detect hangs.
**Action:** Display a wall-clock timer (MM:SS) that starts immediately and freezes upon completion.

## 2026-02-19 - Human-Readable Large Numbers
**Learning:** Raw integers (e.g., 1234567) are difficult to parse visually in CLI/TUI interfaces, especially for file counts.
**Action:** Always format large numbers with locale-appropriate separators (e.g., 1,234,567) to improve glanceability.
