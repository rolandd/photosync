## 2026-02-04 - TOCTOU Vulnerability in fs::copy
**Vulnerability:** A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition was identified in the file copying logic. The application checked if a destination file existed before copying, but `fs::copy` was not atomic with this check. An attacker could create a symlink at the destination between the check and the copy, causing the application to overwrite an arbitrary file (the symlink target) with the user's permissions.
**Learning:** `fs::copy` in Rust (and many other languages) implicitly follows symlinks at the destination if the file exists. Using `dest_path.exists()` is insufficient to prevent overwriting.
**Prevention:** Use `fs::OpenOptions` with `.create_new(true)` to atomically create and open the destination file. If it exists (or is a symlink), the operation fails, preventing the race. Use `io::copy` to transfer data to the newly created file handle.

## 2026-02-04 - Unsafe Permission Propagation in File Copy
**Vulnerability:** The `atomic_copy` function blindly copied all permission bits from the source file to the destination using `set_permissions`. This allowed files from FAT filesystems (which often appear as world-executable) to be copied as executable files to the user's library.
**Learning:** "Best effort" metadata copying must be sanitized. Copying permission bits without filtering can introduce security risks (e.g., executable images).
**Prevention:** When copying files, either rely on the default umask (don't copy permissions) or explicitly mask out dangerous bits (like `0o111`) if preserving other attributes (like read-only status) is required.
