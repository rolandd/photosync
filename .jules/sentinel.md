## 2026-02-04 - TOCTOU Vulnerability in fs::copy
**Vulnerability:** A Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition was identified in the file copying logic. The application checked if a destination file existed before copying, but `fs::copy` was not atomic with this check. An attacker could create a symlink at the destination between the check and the copy, causing the application to overwrite an arbitrary file (the symlink target) with the user's permissions.
**Learning:** `fs::copy` in Rust (and many other languages) implicitly follows symlinks at the destination if the file exists. Using `dest_path.exists()` is insufficient to prevent overwriting.
**Prevention:** Use `fs::OpenOptions` with `.create_new(true)` to atomically create and open the destination file. If it exists (or is a symlink), the operation fails, preventing the race. Use `io::copy` to transfer data to the newly created file handle.

## 2026-02-04 - Unsafe Permission Propagation in File Copy
**Vulnerability:** The `atomic_copy` function blindly copied all permission bits from the source file to the destination using `set_permissions`. This allowed files from FAT filesystems (which often appear as world-executable) to be copied as executable files to the user's library.
**Learning:** "Best effort" metadata copying must be sanitized. Copying permission bits without filtering can introduce security risks (e.g., executable images).
**Prevention:** When copying files, either rely on the default umask (don't copy permissions) or explicitly mask out dangerous bits (like `0o111`) if preserving other attributes (like read-only status) is required.

## 2026-02-04 - Terminal Injection via Filenames
**Vulnerability:** Filenames and EXIF data containing ANSI escape codes or control characters were displayed raw in the TUI and text logs, allowing potential terminal manipulation.
**Learning:** `Path::display()` does not sanitize control characters. It only escapes invalid UTF-8 (using replacement characters), but valid UTF-8 control codes are passed through.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize user-controlled strings (filenames, metadata) before displaying them in a terminal. Use a helper function to replace control characters with a safe placeholder (like `?`).

## 2026-02-04 - Partial File Corruption on Copy Failure
**Vulnerability:** `atomic_copy_file` used `create_new(true)` to avoid overwriting, but if the subsequent `io::copy` failed (e.g., disk full), it left a partially written file at the destination. This corrupted state prevented future syncs (as the file appeared to exist) and could lead to data loss perception.
**Learning:** Atomic file creation is not enough; the entire copy operation must be atomic. If an operation fails mid-way, it must rollback its side effects (delete the incomplete file).
**Prevention:** Implement a try-catch-cleanup pattern for file operations: if the operation returns an error, catch it, perform cleanup (remove the file), and then propagate the error. "Fail securely" means leaving the system in a consistent state.
